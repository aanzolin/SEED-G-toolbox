### SEED-G: Simulated EEG Data Generator for testing connectivity algorithms
SEED-G toolbox was developed in MATLAB environment and is publicly availa-ble at https://github.com/aanzolin/SEED-G-toolbox .
In the proposed toolbox, the generation of pseudo-EEG data that reproduce well-known ground-truth networks is performed using 
multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models as a generator filter to provide a benchmark for functional connectivity estimates. 
**Figure 1** synthesizes the simulated EEG data generation process, including the definition of the ground-truth and the generation 
of the time series.
